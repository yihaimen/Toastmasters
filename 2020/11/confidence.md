Speaking seems the easiest and simplest skill ever.

but when we speak to a group of people or a broader audience.

it gets much more difficult, we start panicking, we start getting nervous.

and a job that seemed simple suddenly becomes challenging, it even feels scary to try.

if you have ever tried to speak on a stage in front of a large audience.

you know what I am talking about.

but that's not the only problem, because even when we speak to friends or a small group of people.

we don't always feel confident, and that makes it even more difficult to express your point of view.

It feels horrible because you have this fantastic idea in your mind.
